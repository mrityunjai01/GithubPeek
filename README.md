# What's behind this?
 - ### Bootstrap
    I googled a lot of bootstrap components, submit buttons, navbars, container sizes, list-groups, etc. 
[this link helped](https://websitesetup.org/bootstrap-tutorial-for-beginners/)
- ### Vertical tabs to represent the repos and collaborators
    I googled up to find [this](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/81A3)
- ### jQuery
   jQuery helped select things, write function callbacks, get form data, and append objects in DOM.
- ### webpack
    Webpack is not necessary to do things, although it did ease the job for me. It basically condenses all .js files (including those from jquery and bootstrap) into one .js and makes dependency management great. You can view my webpack config in the file /webpack.common.js. [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- ### axios
    Good client for API requests. The API was [Github REST api](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).
- ### Markdown editing
   Used [this](https://dillinger.io/)
